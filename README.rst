awc
===

A Wayland compositor using `wlroots`_ written in Swift.

It is heavily inspired, conceptually as well as code-wise, from `XMonad`_.


Alternatives
============

There is a variety of other Wayland compositors if you don't like Awc. Following
are listed a few (without any claim to completeness):

* `hikari <https://hikari.acmelabs.space/>`_
* `river <https://github.com/ifreund/river>`_
* `Sway <https://swaywm.org/>`_
* `Wayfire <https://wayfire.org/>`_

GNOME and KDE also work well with Waland.
